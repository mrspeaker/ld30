# LD30 entry

Here we goes again!

## Connected World Cabs

- You're a cab driver, talking people between planets
- Search for fares, and navigate to the planet
- Land and pick up, then fly to destination planet
- Collect fare.

- Areas have different levels of danger
- Safe areas, nothing happens === lower fares
- Dangerous areas, people shooting at you, falling landscape === higher fares

- Upgrade, refuel stops.
	- buy ammo
	- buy shields for space

- If you run out of fuel, you crash on a planet... 
	- In space? Depot will come get you eventually... can be dangerous
- When you crash? depot spots you new thing, costs money. 

- If you're broke, game over.

## Style

Dystopian future: Connected Worlds, in a disconnected era.

You are Han-Solo type character, just trying to make a buck. 

Go wacky on this one: rainbow thrusters, sparkly particles, wacky song?
